This project was the final project of my Programming Langauges class. In this project, I combined C++ and Python to create a program that takes input from a file and prints the data that the user requests. There were three differnt ways the user could ask for data. 1: Print a list of each item and how many times it appeared. 2: search for an item and print how many times it appears. 3: Display a text histogram that shows how many times each item appeared in the list.


The thing that I think I did particularly well in this project was using Python to code my functions and then calling those functions in the C++ prgoram.

I could enchance my code by adding more functions for Python in there to do more things, or add some more C++ into the project.

The pieces that were most challenging was the C++ calling the Python functions. This was my first attempt at this so it was something new to learn. I overcame it by practicing with the code and using differnt warning messages if something wasn't working correctly. I also used working messages that printed if a certain part of my program was working.

Combining the two languages will be a very transferable skill that I can use in other projects.

I made this program maintainable by making my functions in Python. This way, if the code needs to be reused or editied, you know where to find the functions or other parts of the code because each part is in either C++ or Python.
